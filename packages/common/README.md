# Entomophage-common

This is a common library for multiple services.

## Types

This is where common types are stored. For now there are only queue types and issue enums, but both services use this.

## Queue

Common queue code is here too. Exported channels are here for communication.

## Work in progress

As this is an alpha it is a mvp not a generic implementation for scalability.
